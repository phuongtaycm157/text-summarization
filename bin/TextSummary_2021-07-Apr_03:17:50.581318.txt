A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception.
